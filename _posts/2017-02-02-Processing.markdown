Processing lets you jump directly to the canvas. Start drawing with a couple lines of code, and add a couple more to have interaction with the mouse and keyboard; you can even add interactions with your own hardware, thanks to Arduino.

This workshop is aimed to high school students interested in programming and electronics. They program a game, complete with visual interface, and build their own game controller using Arduino.

Tools used: Processing, Arduino.

Time for this workshop: 2.5 hours (requires knowledge of Arduino) or 4 hours (no requirements)
