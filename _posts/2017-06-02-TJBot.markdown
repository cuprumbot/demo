TJBot can dance, respond to emotions and engage into conversation with the service that Watson offers.

Status: In progress.

#### Description

TJBot, or Larry, as we call him, can dance to any song with its little arm and respond to different emotions almost as well as it can engage into conversation with the text to speech service that Watson offers. It can look through a Twitter feed to indicate the general opinion on an specific word of subject that he hears, through an LED, or come up with a color after being asked for it. He was inspired by an IBM open source project that involves a Raspberry Pi 3, a servo motor, a RGB LED, a microphone, speaker, Node JS, and Watson Services to make it a really interesting experience that we are currently working on some improvements to give it a little bit of a Guatemalan twist, but do not worry, we will be keeping you posted!
