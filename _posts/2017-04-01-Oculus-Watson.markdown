Tools: Oculus Rift + Unity + IBM Watson (text-to-speech) + IBM Watson (conversation)

Status: Finished.

#### Description

Using the Oculus Rift you are able to stay in a virtual environment, and with the power of the IBM Watson services you are also able to create objects inside that environment with your speech, so you could say "create dinosaur" and a dinosaur will appear in front of you.
