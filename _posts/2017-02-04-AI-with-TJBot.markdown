The main object of this workshop consists on learning how to work with a Raspberry Pi 3, incorporating Watson Services so that it may be able to do language recognition and indicate or respond to different emotions, or even the weather, through a RGB LED. Also, it can be programmed to talk back with the Text to Speech option. And, if that was not enough, it can dance to the beat of any song you like with the use of servo motors, making it a cool --super cute-- project to start this learning experience. This workshop is specifically targeted to high school students to get them involved in the process of learning about AI as early on as possible in a fun and simple way.

Tools used: Raspberry Pi, IBM Watson

Time for this workshop: 4 hours
